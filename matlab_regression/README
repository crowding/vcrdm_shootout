To translate the VCRDM algorithm into other languages, or even extend
it safely, we must first obtain the ground truth of that the existing
VCRDM code actually _does_. That is, we need a regression test to
verify that future algorithms do the same thing as the present
algorithm.

The input to the VCRDM algorithm is a stream of random numbers, and
the output is a set of dot positions, organized by frame. Therefore to
characterize the VCRDM algorithm, we must capture examples of how the
dots algorithm transforms random number draws into plotted dot
positions.

To do this I have replaced the rand() and Screen() functions with stubs
that capture and record their input and output, while leaving the rest of
the original VCRDM code unmolested (except for some package declarations
that make it possible to insert these stubs.)

To verify the captured data, I use the stubs to feed the same sequence
of random numbers back into the VCRDM routines and confirm that the
same dot positions are plotted.

In future, even when both MATLAB and Psychtoolbox have been abandoned,
this regression testing data will remain.

Just run "make" to exercise the VCRDM algorithm and produce the
regression testing data.
